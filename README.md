# lz-jsx-render

## How to use it

```sh
# On your terminal

mkdir sample \
&& cd $_ \
&& npx lz-cli gh alecsgone/lz-jsx-render
```

- This command will create a folder, enter to that folder and it will use [lz-cli](https://github.com/alecsgone/lz-cli) to fetch the template and ask you a few useful questions to create the sample app.
